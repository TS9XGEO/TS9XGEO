- 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas.
- 👀 I’m interested in spatial data analysis, geostatistics, remote sensing and urban geography.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to optimize data processing for spatial and non-spatial data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever catches my interest. Hit me up with your ideas, if you think I can contribute something meaningful.
